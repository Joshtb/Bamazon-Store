# Bamazon-Store

#Description

##This is a node.js store front. It has products and stock quantitys in a table. When you look up an ID of an item and type in the quantity of the item it will update the table and let you know the price of what was purchased.


## The important part of this is being able to update mySQL in your node terminal/bash. Remember to require mysql.

[Heres a video on how it works]
